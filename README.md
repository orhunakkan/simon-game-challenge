Simon Game
Welcome to Simon Game's repository! This simple and fun project offers a digital version of the classic memory game, Simon.

Game Description
Simon is a game of memory skill that was popular in the 80s. This game creates a series of tones and lights and requires the user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

In this version of Simon:
We use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and develop the game.
The game board consists of four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device.
A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons.

How to Play
- Press the Start button.
- Watch and listen for the sequence presented.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
- The sequence gets longer each round.
- If you miss a sequence, the game will end.
- Press Start to play again.
